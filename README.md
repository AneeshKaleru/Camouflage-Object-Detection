# Camouflage-Object-Detection
 
The Camouflage Object Detection System utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale datasets to differentiate between camouflaged objects and their surroundings. By employing data augmentation techniques, the system achieves high accuracy and robustness across various environmental conditions and camouflage types. This project aims to fill the gap in research by focusing on achieving real-time detection capability for camouflage objects using deep learning methods, enhancing the practical applicability of camouflage detection systems in dynamic environments.

**UNET MODEL**
The Unet Model is dedicated to implementing the Unet architecture, specifically designed for semantic segmentation of camouflage objects within complex backgrounds. It utilizes convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and employs a symmetric encoder-decoder architecture. This architecture includes skip connections to preserve spatial information effectively, enabling accurate segmentation of camouflage objects even within intricate backgrounds.

**YOLOv8**
The YOLO Model is responsible for implementing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, specifically tailored for real-time object detection of camouflage objects. This module utilizes convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and incorporates a grid cell mechanism for precise object localization. Additionally, it employs non-max suppression for post-processing, effectively eliminating duplicate detections and ensuring accurate and reliable detection results.
